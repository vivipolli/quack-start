# 1.1 What’s DuckChain?

DuckChain is the Telegram AI Chain and is the largest EVM chain in Telegram, bridging over **1 billion Telegram users** into the Web3 ecosystem. Built on **Scaling Labs** and powered by **Arbitrum Orbit**, DuckChain integrates AI-driven solutions, EVM compatibility, and seamless blockchain accessibility to enable **mass adoption** like never before.

By enabling seamless integration with telegram ecosystem and AI-driven tools, DuckChain accelerates the goal of crypto mass adoption while simplifying user onboarding with features like unified gas payments and intuitive interactions. It empowers both users and developers, driving blockchain adoption through interoperability and scalability.\
\
As the Telegram AI Chain designed specifically for Telegram’s 1 billion+ global users, DuckChain plays a key role in transforming Telegram into a blockchain-powered super-app.

# 1.2 Background

The blockchain industry has made phenomenal progress  in recent years, yet its mass adoption remains hindered by complex user interfaces, steep learning curves, and fragmented systems. \
\
For the average user, engaging with blockchain technology often involves navigating multiple steps—setting up wallets, securing private keys, and managing gas tokens across various networks. This process is tiring for web2 users who are used to frictionless onboarding

Even The Open Network (TON), a blockchain integrated with Telegram's ecosystem of over 1 billion global users, faces challenges. While TON provides scalability and direct access to a massive audience, it lacks the infrastructure to foster deep user engagement and developer adoption.&#x20;

### **Challenges**

* **Limited Developer Ecosystem:** TON's native languages (Fift, FunC, and Tact) are less accessible compared to EVM-based tooling, deterring developer participation.
* **Fragmented User Experience:** TON users face hurdles with tools that require multiple platforms for transactions, reducing ease of access for Web2 adopters.
* **Liquidity and Funding Gaps:** TON struggles with low Total Value Locked (TVL) and limited financial incentives for developers.

These issues highlight a critical gap in the market—a need for a consumer-centric blockchain solution that integrates seamlessly with popular platforms like Telegram, reduces complexity, and fosters user-friendly interactions.

DuckChain fills this gap as the first Telegram AI Chain, designed to simplify blockchain interactions for both developers and users. Leveraging the robust infrastructure of Arbitrum Orbit and seamless integration with Ethereum and Bitcoin ecosystems, DuckChain provides a streamlined pathway for Web2 users to enter Web3.\
\
Its mission is to make blockchain technology as accessible as sending a message on Telegram, turning abstract blockchain concepts into tangible, user-focused solutions.
